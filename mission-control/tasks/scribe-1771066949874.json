**POST 1: Before/After Transformation**

🚨 BEFORE & AFTER: Mentone Bathroom 🚨

Swipe to see this 1980s nightmare transform into a spa-like retreat →

**BEFORE:**
❌ Dated pink tiles
❌ Leaky fixtures  
❌ Zero storage
❌ That 80s vibe we all want to forget

**AFTER:**
✨ Floor-to-ceiling 600x600 porcelain tiles
✨ Walk-in shower with engineered stone base
✨ Wall-hung vanity (hello, floor space!)
✨ Heated towel rail (winter game changer)

📍 Mentone, Bayside & Mornington Peninsula
💰 Finished on time, on budget, no hidden costs
😊 One VERY happy client still smiling weeks later

**POST 2: Problem/Pain Point**

Still got an 80s bathroom? We need to talk 👇

That pink bathtub. The cracked tiles. The "vintage" look that's actually just... old.

This Mentone client lived with it for 15 years. Finally said "enough."

3 weeks later? Zero regrets.

✅ Fixed price quote (no surprises)
✅ On-time guarantee  
✅ Clean, respectful trades
✅ Full project management from start to finish

"If only I'd done this sooner" — actual Cherry Builds client

**POST 3: Social Proof/Testimonial**

"I actually look forward to showering now" 😍

— Sarah, Mentone

This family put up with their 1980s bathroom for 15 years.

The breaking point? The third leak in 6 months.

We came in and:
🔨 Stripped it back completely
💧 Re-plumbed & re-wired
✨ Installed 600x600 porcelain tiles
🚿 Added that walk-in shower they always wanted
🔥 Heated towel rail for Melbourne winters

**The result?**
✅ Finished on time
✅ On budget  
✅ No hidden costs
✅ One VERY happy client

"The team was professional, clean, and the result is better than we imagined" — Sarah, Mentone
