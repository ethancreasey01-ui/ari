## Post 1: The Problem/Solution Hook
**Hook:** Tired of paying monthly for a website that does nothing?

**Body:**
Most tradies get stuck with:
❌ $200+/month website subscriptions
❌ Sites that look generic
❌ No leads coming in
❌ Can't update it yourself

We do it differently:
✅ One set price ($999-$2,999)
✅ Custom design for YOUR trade
✅ Built to rank on Google
✅ You own it forever

No ongoing fees. No lock-in contracts. Just a website that actually gets you calls.

## Post 2: Proof/Social Proof
**Hook:** "I got 3 calls in the first week!" - Mike, Electrician

**Body:**
Real results from real tradies:

🔌 Dave (Electrician): "Finally have a website I'm proud to show customers. Booked 2 jobs from it already."

🔧 Sarah (Plumber): "Best investment I've made. No more explaining my services over the phone - they see it all on the site."

🔐 Tom (Locksmith): "Shows up on Google when people search 'locksmith near me'. Pays for itself."

Your website should work as hard as you do.

## Post 3: Education/Value
**Hook:** 3 things your tradie website MUST have (most don't)

**Body:**
1️⃣ **Mobile-friendly design**
80% of your customers are searching on their phone. If your site doesn't work on mobile, you're losing jobs.

2️⃣ **Clear call-to-action**
"Call now" buttons that actually work. Click-to-call, quote forms, online booking.

3️⃣ **Local SEO**
You need to show up when someone searches "[your trade] near me"

Most cheap website builders miss ALL of these.

We build sites specifically for tradies that tick every box.

**Hook:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Finally, a website company that understands tradies"

**Body:**

What I liked:
- They actually listened to what I wanted
- Showed me examples of other electrician sites
- Didn't try to sell me stuff I don't need
- Taught me how to update it myself

If you're a tradie in Melbourne, just call them."
