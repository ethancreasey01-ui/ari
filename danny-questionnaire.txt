**Subject:** Quick Questions to Build Your Lead Gen Plan

Hey Danny,

Before I put together a proper plan for Cherry Builds & Aqua Tight, I need to understand where you're at. Can you reply with answers to these?

### **Current Marketing**

1. **Facebook:** Are you currently running paid FB ads, or just posting in groups organically?

2. **Google Ads:** Have you ever run Google Ads before? If yes, what was the result?

3. **Current Ad Spend:** What (if anything) are you spending on marketing right now?

4. **Google Business:** I could only find 2 Facebook reviews for Cherry Builds. **Do you have a Google Business Profile set up?** (If not, this is urgent!)

### **Budget & Goals**

5. **Monthly Budget:** What monthly budget could you commit to ads? (Ballpark is fine — $500? $1k? $2k+?)

6. **Lead Goal:** How many new leads per month would make you happy? (1-2? 5? 10+?)

7. **Average Job Value:** What's a typical bathroom/kitchen renovation worth to you? ($20k? $50k? $80k+?)

8. **Target Suburbs:** Which suburbs are you happiest traveling to? (Mornington, Brighton, Frankston, etc.)

### **Assets & Content**

9. **Photos:** Do you have before/after photos from past projects we can use?

### **Pain Points**

10. **Cherry Builds:** Why do you think it's "dead" while Aqua Tight is getting work?

11. **Competitors:** Who's your biggest competitor locally? (Smith & Sons, Refresh, etc.?)
