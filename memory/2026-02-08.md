## Major Progress: Meal Planner Web App

Built a complete drag-and-drop meal planning application with Apple Reminders integration.

### Features Completed:

**Core Functionality:**
- ✅ Drag & drop recipes onto weekly calendar (lunch/dinner slots)
- ✅ Recipe thumbnails using food emojis (🍔, 🍜, 🌯, etc.)
- ✅ Macro tracking per person (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
- ✅ Servings selector (cook for 1-20 people)
- ✅ Week navigation (this week, next week, etc.)

**Apple Reminders Integration:**
- ✅ Creates TWO separate lists:
  - "📅 This Week's Meals" - meal schedule with days
  - "🛒 Shopping List" - organized ingredients
- ✅ Recipe URLs included in meal plan
- ✅ Matching emojis in Reminders
- ✅ Days of week displayed with lunch/dinner
- ✅ Store categories (produce, meat, dairy, pantry, frozen, bakery, drinks)
- ✅ Clear lists button to start fresh
- ✅ Progress bar when generating shopping list

**Design:**
- ✅ Clean Apple iOS aesthetic (SF Pro fonts, iOS blue #007AFF)
- ✅ White cards with subtle shadows
- ✅ Rounded corners (16px radius)
- ✅ Responsive layout

**Recipes Added:**
1. 🌯 Cheesy Chicken Fajita Wraps
2. 🌯 Korean BBQ Chicken Wraps
